# ADR-002: Single Shared Helm Chart for All Services

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-05-14
**Deciders:** Platform team

---

## Context

Five NimbusRetail microservices need Kubernetes packaging. Options considered:

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| A | One independent Helm chart per service (5 charts) |
| B | One shared chart with per-service values files |
| C | Kustomize base + overlays |

## Decision

**Option B** – a single chart at `helm/nimbus-service/` with five
`values-<service>.yaml` overrides.

## Rationale

All five services share the same Kubernetes structure: a `Deployment`, a `ClusterIP`
`Service`, a named port `http`, probes at `/healthz` and `/readyz`, and optional HPA.
Duplicating the template logic across five charts would create five places to update
for every structural change (e.g. adding a sidecar, changing probe paths).

Per-service values files (`values-auth.yaml`, `values-catalog.yaml`, etc.) provide
full customisation of image repository, port, environment variables, secret references,
and HPA settings without duplicating template code.

ArgoCD supports this pattern natively – each child app references the same `path`
with a different `helm.valueFiles` entry.

Option C (Kustomize) was rejected because the team is more familiar with Helm and
the project already uses Helm for all operator deployments (Strimzi, Kyverno, ESO, etc.).

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Single template to maintain for all structural changes
- Per-service values files are readable and self-documenting
- Adding a sixth service requires only a new values file and ArgoCD app

**Negative:**
- Services with fundamentally different structures (e.g. a StatefulSet) would need
  the shared chart extended or a separate chart
- `helm lint` must be run with a specific values file to be meaningful

**Mitigation:** `catalog-service` uses a separate secret (`nimbus-catalog-secrets`)
because its `DATABASE_URL` requires the `postgresql://` prefix for asyncpg, not
`postgres://`. This difference is handled entirely in the values file without
any template change.
