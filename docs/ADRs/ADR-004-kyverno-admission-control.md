# ADR-004: Kyverno over OPA/Gatekeeper for Admission Control

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-05-19
**Deciders:** Platform team

---

## Context

The platform requires a Kubernetes admission controller to enforce security policies:
no privileged containers, mandatory resource limits, image tag discipline. Options:

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| A | OPA / Gatekeeper – Rego policies, CNCF graduated |
| B | Kyverno – Kubernetes-native YAML policies, CNCF graduated |
| C | Pod Security Standards (built-in) – namespace-level only |

## Decision

**Option B** – Kyverno.

## Rationale

**OPA/Gatekeeper** requires writing policies in Rego, a purpose-built policy language.
Rego is powerful but has a steep learning curve and is difficult to test locally
without the `opa` CLI.

**Kyverno** policies are written in YAML using Kubernetes-native patterns (selectors,
patterns, JSON patches). A platform engineer familiar with Kubernetes manifests can
read and write Kyverno policies without learning a new language.

**Pod Security Standards** (Option C) operate at the namespace level with three
fixed profiles (Privileged, Baseline, Restricted). They cannot enforce custom rules
such as "require resource limits" or "disallow `:latest` tag."

Both OPA and Kyverno are CNCF-graduated, so maturity is not a differentiator.
Kyverno's simpler authoring model is the deciding factor for this project.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Policies are readable YAML – reviewable in pull requests without Rego knowledge
- `Audit` mode allows gradual policy rollout without breaking existing workloads
- `PolicyReport` CRs provide a queryable violation log

**Negative:**
- Kyverno runs in `kyverno` namespace and adds ~200 MiB memory overhead
- Complex policies (multi-resource dependencies) are harder in Kyverno than Rego

**Policy rollout strategy:**
- `Enforce` immediately: `disallow-privileged-containers`, `require-resource-limits`
  (the Helm chart already sets limits on all Nimbus pods)
- `Audit` first: `disallow-latest-tag`, `require-app-label`
  (switch to `Enforce` after confirming all workloads are compliant via `PolicyReport`)
